# ChaoticBouncingBalls

A simple animation made with Pygame meant to show a concept of chaos theory: minimal changes of input have huge impact on output (high sensitivity to initial conditions).

Inspired by the Numberphile video "Chaotic Balls" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z4qRhpBIyA&t=58s

Since they did not publish the source code i implemented it myself.

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9inQmg8ms3k

The minimal difference of starting positions of the two balls leads to a completely different path after just a few bounces.

To experiment with it yourself:

1. Clone / Download zip
2. Install requirements:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  OR
  - pip install pygame
3. Edit initial conditions (ball positions, velocity, accelleration, etc.) in main.py
